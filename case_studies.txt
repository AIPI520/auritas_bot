Nielsen Holdings PLC, an American information, data, and market measurement firm operating in over 100 countries with approximately 44,000 employees worldwide and assets over 3.5 Billion dollars, sought to implement and streamline SAP BTP Document Management. Founded in 1923, Nielsen looked to embrace SAP BTP's capabilities after transitioning to S/4HANA. The company collaborated with Auritas and SAP to optimize its document management processes using ArchiveLink and SAP Document Management System (DMS).   
Following the divestiture of its Buy and Watch business units and adoption of S/4HANA, Nielsen Media recognized the power and flexibility of SAP's Business Technology Platform (BTP), particularly for document management. A Proof of Value (POV), developed jointly by Auritas and SAP, highlighted the financial and flexibility advantages of BTP over Nielsen's existing operations, including integration options and custom app development possibilities. The primary objectives were to enable the SAP Cloud Connector on Nielsen's BTP subaccount, implement BTP Document Management Service for SAP Office and DMS, enhance document management process efficiency, and facilitate the establishment of retention management policies.   
To achieve these goals, Auritas implemented a solution integrating Nielsen's SAP systems with BTP using ArchiveLink and SAP DMS. ArchiveLink was used to migrate attachments from the SAP database to the BTP environment by adjusting configurations for business objects, enabling seamless access to documents stored on BTP from within SAP. Building on this foundation, Nielsen independently migrated additional data and created new objects, streamlining the process and enabling effective retention management. For SAP DMS, SAPOffice DMS Documents were configured as storage containers to transfer documents from SAPOffice to BTP. Attachments without business object configurations were segregated and moved to BTP for effective retention management. Thorough validation, including test migrations, ensured the configuration's efficacy for smooth document migration and management, significantly advancing Nielsen's document management capabilities and efficiency through BTP integration.   
The project resulted in several benefits for Nielsen Holdings, including data and document segregation to support retention management, cost savings due to SAP BTP's cost-effectiveness, and a better position for technological updates. Nielsen quickly became self-sufficient, enhanced the efficiency of its content management strategies, and leveraged the storage benefits offered by SAP BTP. Following the initial engagement, Nielsen continued configuring new business objects and migrating documents from SAPOffice to DMS to BTP, and also began integrating BTP Document Management with Ariba.

NVIDIA Corporation, a leading manufacturer of high-end graphics processing units (GPUs), mobile technologies, integrated circuits, and desktop computers, faced challenges with its finance system, including frequent downtime and incorrect supplier payments. Having invented the GPU in 1999, NVIDIA grew into one of the world's largest companies by 2023, with its technologies powering filmmaking, game development, and top supercomputers. Seeking to modernize and automate its finance operations, NVIDIA partnered with SAP, OpenText, and Auritas after a failed modernization attempt in 2019. The goal was a global invoice management transformation, aiming for standardization and touchless automation.   
The business problem stemmed from the failed 2019 invoice processing system modernization. NVIDIA experienced production failures, operational risks like code failures and system downtime leading to wrong supplier payments, compliance risks including a Sarbanes Oxley Deficiency in FY2019 due to heavy manual controls, issues with the scalability of their current tools, and business continuity risks related to vendor stability. Recognizing the need for a robust solution, NVIDIA's EVP Finance & CFO, Colette Kress, emphasized finance automation as a top priority, starting with Accounts Payable. NVIDIA collaborated with Auritas to develop an action plan to address these issues and ensure sustainable growth.   
Auritas drafted an action plan starting with a global solution template for invoice management, initially focusing on indirect spend with plans to extend to direct spend. The plan aimed for best-in-class operational metrics, alignment of the procure-to-pay system, decommissioning legacy systems while maintaining data accessibility, and implementing a change management strategy for over 20,000 employees. The solution was rolled out in phases: Phase 1 involved creating a Global Blueprint based in Santa Clara, securing stakeholder buy-in, assessing vendor master data, and getting CFO approval for policy updates. Phase 2 focused on Key Innovations for the US & EMEA, including Auto Goods Receipt, One Source Tax Integration, digitized vendor master cleanup, Auto Accruals, Top Vendor Optimization using AI, intuitive and mobile-enabled Fiori Apps for the large user base, and Invoice-PO Matching. Phase 3 covered the APAC Roll Out & Israel Onboarding, incorporating APAC localization, Israel SAP conversion, e-invoicing, change management execution, SOX rewrite, user provisioning, and a High Availability Cluster. Phase 4 involved the S/4 Transition & Optimization, including S/L AP Brownfield Migration, optimization in ECC, and planning for future Direct EDI on-boarding and an AP Control Tower.   
The project, completed in nine months, yielded significant results and benefits. NVIDIA achieved 51 percent touchless global automation within three months post-rollout, established a unified ECC platform for 49 entities, and addressed 145 global requirements. The transformation delivered scalable automation, standardized workflows, an intuitive mobile-enabled FIORI user experience, and global standardization of the indirect invoice end-to-end process, with plans to add direct spend. The system now operates continuously, providing history, visibility, security, a single system of document control, and enhanced compliance with local regulations. Robert Loreto, Director of IT, praised Auritas as a great partner provided by SAP, making the transformation smooth and easy.   

Toro, a leading worldwide provider of innovative solutions for the outdoor environment including turf maintenance, snow management, landscape, rental and specialty construction equipment, and irrigation solutions, faced challenges with labor-intensive and time-consuming vendor invoicing processes. Founded in 1914, the company had expanded to over 125 countries by 2023, employing over 6,800 people worldwide with an approximate annual revenue of 3.96B dollars as of 2021. Despite previous modernizations, the lack of automation and optimization in their financial workflows hindered scalability, performance measurement, and created difficulties in achieving an efficient invoicing process. Key pain points included heavy manual labor needs, long processing times, difficulties in measuring supplier performance, a large number of exceptions, and reliance on customizations instead of business rules. Toro aimed to grow a digital future, eliminate key touchpoints, and standardize towards common efficient processes globally.   
To address these issues, Toro connected with Auritas for assistance. Auritas' experts developed an action plan starting with an assessment of the current invoicing process, focusing on enabling scalability through standard global practices. The solution emphasized leading change with business processes rather than just technology, building a cross-functional change coalition to foster cultural change. Auritas implemented SAP validation, rejection, exception handling, workflow, approval, and posting with minimal customizations, integrated EDI and automated ingestion of emailed invoices, and architected a future state supplier portal integration. The implementation was phased: Phase 1 focused on digitalization (growing EDI, automating email, reducing paper), Phase 2 on standardization (standard processes, PO driven, line-item matching, minimum touch exception path, robust business rules, digitized workflows), Phase 3 on acceleration (reviewing policy, eliminating touchpoints, analytics), Phase 4 on operation (establishing SSC, measuring performance, benchmarking, vendor adoption), and Phase 5 on optimization (actionable improvements, supplier portal integration, continuous improvement).   
The project, completed in just over 12 months, yielded significant benefits for Toro. Over 700,000 invoices were processed (55 percent EDI, 45 percent email/paper), and the touchless processing rate increased globally from 0-20 percent to over 85 percent. The invoice processing cycle time was drastically reduced from 18 days to 4.5 days, and relationships with suppliers greatly improved. Toro plans to continue improving its processes by implementing and integrating a supplier portal, extending standard POs for MRO expenses, growing digital invoicing while targeting paper reduction, and resolving vendor exceptions through supplier performance meetings.   

Many organizations using OpenText, the leading Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solution for SAP, find it necessary to move their infrastructure to the cloud to align with long-term strategies, implement new functionality, and streamline business processes.

Auritas provides expert SAP and OpenText consulting services to stabilize, move, and consolidate data from existing systems and storage centers, helping accomplish digital transformation objectives.   
One organization's financial division, having utilized OpenText's Enterprise Information Management (EIM) capabilities for years, migrated its business system to the cloud as part of a long-term strategy to improve access, storage, and reduce support costs. This major effort, conducted in July 2020, involved migrating over 30 terabytes of data from outdated storage centers. The digital transformation included upgrading, stabilizing, and moving the on-premise OpenText Document Access system to cloud services, alongside consolidating data from disparate storage centers.   
Auritas collaborated with the company's team, OpenText Public Sector Solutions (OTPSS), and other key technology partners, providing expert SAP and OpenText implementation and support services. The solution involved stabilizing the on-premise OpenText landscape before migration, setting up and configuring six OpenText environments in the cloud, and migrating the on-premise content. The project scope included "Design and Blueprint" workshops, creating 6 OpenText Archive environments in Amazon Web Services (AWS), connecting 8 SAP systems to these environments, migrating 8 terabytes of data initially, performing SAP archiving beforehand to ensure the SAP HANA database was lean for cost-effectiveness and performance, successful testing including Disaster Recovery, and post-go-live Hypercare. This process paved the way for further archiving opportunities.   
The OpenText migration to the AWS Cloud was successful, completed on budget, ahead of schedule, and without user impact. Key benefits included savings upwards of 10 million dollars by eliminating mandatory 5-year technology refreshes. The OpenText data and systems are now cloud-based, readily available to users, supported by AWS, and are more visible, accessible, understandable, trusted, interoperable, and secure, resulting in improved user experience, reliability, and disaster recovery. A representative noted the effort underscored the ability to provide modern solutions benefiting the workforce and the organization.

A Chemical Enterprise, like many organizations, used numerous applications over time. As technology evolved, new applications were implemented and older ones replaced, resulting in a portfolio of over 200 legacy SAP and non-SAP applications requiring decommissioning. Due to data retention and compliance requirements, data within these legacy systems needed to remain readily available for retrieval. The objective was to partner with Auritas, a trusted enterprise data and document management firm, to design and build a repeatable decommissioning capability for the existing and future legacy applications. Project requirements included identifying necessary information to assess data/systems, executing a methodology for gathering this information and designing a solution, proposing tools for data extraction, tagging/storage, retrieval, and retention/destruction management, and providing a roadmap for the customer's team to perform the decommissioning.   
Auritas initiated the project by reviewing the customer's legacy system portfolio and gathered information, identifying gaps, developing questionnaires to collect missing details, compiling results, conducting workshops, and delivering final recommendations. Scoring scenarios evaluated requirements and provided weighted results for potential data and system solutions, with active support from the Customer Steering Committee being crucial. The final deliverable detailed a set of 2-4 tools/systems for decommissioning, covering data extraction, transformation (if needed), tagging and storage (e.g., ECM/CRM), efficient retrieval/reporting, and managing retention/destruction. Based on the identified tools, Auritas proposed strategies tailored to customer requirements, such as systems-based (e.g., all SAP R/3, Oracle), retention-based (oldest data first), business unit-based (Finance, HR, etc.), or based on ease of execution and repeatability, which is often preferred to build team confidence.   
The project successfully decommissioned legacy SAP and Non-SAP applications, resulting in millions in savings from retiring systems and related costs. It provided easy access to legacy data from new environments and established a clean, lean, and compliant data strategy along with best practices for future initiatives.   

Puget Sound Energy (PSE), an energy utility company founded in 1997 in Washington state, USA, provides electrical power and natural gas to over a million electric and 900 thousand natural gas customers across 10 counties. With over three thousand employees and revenue of 3.3B dollars, PSE faced challenges managing data scattered across multiple ECM platforms like SAP, Hummingbird, InMagic, EasySoft, File Share, Email, and SharePoint. This siloed data, lack of established controls, and non-optimized processes led to high maintenance costs, difficulty accessing documents, error-prone processes including misfiling or loss of paper documents, inability to guarantee restrictions on unauthorized access, and compliance risks due to limited records management capabilities.   
PSE partnered with Auritas to implement a data management and process optimization solution after issuing an RFP. Auritas developed an action plan starting with assessing requirements and options to create a roadmap for success, followed by workshops to guide the implementation and maintenance process. The chosen solution involved implementing SAP Extended ECM by OpenText to develop standardized taxonomy, consolidate silos, and provide knowledge transfer and user training. The project goals included a strategic transformation for simplified access and search from a single enterprise document and records management system, developing a 5-year roadmap to migrate and retire legacy systems (4 initially), and creating a common records management system with common processes, consolidated management, legal hold preservation, retention/disposition management, and compliance features (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley).   
The implementation occurred in two phases. Phase 1 involved planning and design, including hardware/solution assessments, legacy system analysis, migration roadmap development, taxonomy development, and finalizing the 5-year roadmap. Phase 2 focused on implementing the Enterprise Document and Records Management System (EDRMS), installing solutions like OpenText Extended ECM, Records Management, Capture Center, Application Governance and Archiving for SharePoint, and Email Monitoring/Archiving.
